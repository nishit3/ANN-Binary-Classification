# ANN-Binary-Classification
I'm randomly generating data that can be linearly seperated into class1 (0) and class2 (1). 
 Simple ANN model with 2 neurons in input layer (1 neuron for x-coordinate and 1 for y-coordinate), ReLU as activation function for input layer and 1 neuron in output layer with Sigmoid as activation function is trained.
 There are no hidden layers. Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) is used as loss function.
